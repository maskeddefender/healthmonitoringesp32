IOT BASED HEALTH MONITORING USING ESP32 ALONG WITH BLYNK APPLICATION AND BLYNK CLOUD

With various modern healthcare innovation dispatches, the Web of Things is quickly changing the healthcare industry. Following the wellbeing status of patients at domestic can be a troublesome assignment due to active work and day by day assignments. Particularly elderly patients ought to be checked frequently. So we propose an inventive framework that effortlessly robotizes this errand. Our gadgets are prepared with an shrewdly understanding wellbeing following framework employing blynk application to screen persistent wellbeing parameters such as heart rate, blood oxygen level and body temperature.

So, in this venture, you'll learn how to make an IoT-based persistent wellbeing checking framework venture. Degree heart rate/pulse (BPM) and blood oxygen concentration (SpO2) utilizing the MAX30100 beat oximeter sensor. Degree body temperature utilizing DS18B20 temperature sensor. Moreover, the understanding ought to be set in a room with consistent temperature and stickiness so that he does not feel awkward. For this, you must too control the temperature and stickiness of the room. In this manner, we utilize the mugginess and temperature sensor DHT11.

Keywords— ESP32 development board, DHT11 sensor, DS18B20 sensor, MAX30100, register.


Setup()

The setup() function is executed once when the microcontroller starts.
Serial communication is initiated at a baud rate of 115200 for debugging purposes.
The DHT sensor pin is set as an input.
The DHT sensor is initialized using the DHT.begin() function.
Blynk connection is established using Blynk. Begin () with the provided authentication token, Wi-Fi SSID, and password.
The MAX30100 sensor is initialized using the pox. begin() function. If initialization fails, the program enters an infinite loop.
The MAX30100 sensor’s IR LED current is set to MAX30100_LED_CURR_7_6MA (7.6 mA).

```
//code for setup
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(19, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(DHTPin, INPUT);
  dht.begin();
  Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass);
  Serial.print("Initializing Pulse Oximeter..");

  if (!pox.begin()) {
    Serial.println("FAILED");
    for (;;)
      ;
  } else {
    Serial.println("SUCCESS");
    pox.setOnBeatDetectedCallback(onBeatDetected);
  }
  pox.setIRLedCurrent(MAX30100_LED_CURR_7_6MA);
}
```


Loop()

The loop() function continuously runs after the setup() function.
The pox. update() function is called to update the readings from the MAX30100 sensor.
The Blynk. run() function is called to maintain the connection and handle Blynk-related operations.
The Temperature and Humidity are read from the DHT11 sensor using the DHT.readTemperature() and DHT.readHumidity() functions, respectively.
The BPM and SpO2 are obtained from the MAX30100 sensor using the pox.getHeartRate() and pox.getSpO2() functions, respectively.
The body temperature is read from the DS18B20 sensor using the sensors.getTempCByIndex() function.

```
//code for loop
void loop() {
  pox.update();
  Blynk.run();
  Temperature = dht.readTemperature(); 
  Humidity = dht.readHumidity();       
  BPM = pox.getHeartRate();
  SpO2 = pox.getSpO2();
  bodytemperature = sensors.getTempCByIndex(0);
 
  if (millis() - tsLastReport > REPORTING_PERIOD_MS) {
    Serial.print("Heart rate:");
    Serial.print(BPM);
    Serial.print(" bpm / SpO2:");
    Serial.print(SpO2);
    Serial.println(" %");
    Serial.print("Room Temperature: ");
    Serial.print(Temperature);
    Serial.println("°C");
    Serial.print("Room Humidity: ");
    Serial.print(Humidity);
    Serial.println("%");
    Serial.print("Body Temperature: ");
    Serial.print(bodytemperature);
    Serial.println("°C");
    Blynk.virtualWrite(V3, Temperature);
    Blynk.virtualWrite(V4, Humidity);
    Blynk.virtualWrite(V5, BPM);
    Blynk.virtualWrite(V6, SpO2);
    Blynk.virtualWrite(V7, bodytemperature);
 
    tsLastReport = millis();
  }
}
```
